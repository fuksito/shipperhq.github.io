The ShipperHQ Labels API can be used to produce shipping labels but it is much more powerful when combined with the ShipperHQ [Rates API](../rates/overview.md) and [Insights API](../insights/overview.md). At a minimum, the Insights API must be implemented in order to support storing shipment information used to produce labels.

:::caution Early Access Program

The ShipperHQ Labels API is currently in closed Beta. ShipperHQ is looking for early access partners interested in participating in this program.
Please [contact us](/contact) if interested.

## High level overview

The Labels API is the final API in the standard ShipperHQ workflow. The [Rates API](../rates/overview.md) can be used to provide shipping rates (e.g. in an eCommerce checkout), the [Insights API](../insights/overview.md) is used to retrieve the detailed shipment information generated by ShipperHQ when providing shipping rates. Finally, the Labels API can be used to produce the shipping labels needed for the shipment.

### Workflow

## How does ShipperHQ produce labels?

ShipperHQ's labels are produced by connecting to carrier (or related) APIs using the shipper's account. This means that at least one carrier account is required in order to use the ShipperHQ Labels API.

## Key queries used for labels
The Labels API consists of the following requests:
