The Labels API enables you to produce shipping labels for shipments directly within your application. When used in conjunction with the ShipperHQ [Rates API](../rates/overview.md) and [Insights API](../insights/overview.md) it provides a powerful end-to-end solution for fulfillment.

Some scenarios in which ShipperHQ's Labels API is most useful are:
- **ERPs and WMS**: In systems responsible for managing inventory and orders, the Labels API can be leveraged to provide built-in shipping capabilities.
- **eCommerce Platforms**: For eCommerce platforms looking to support shipping from within the platform dashboard.
- **Order Management and Fulfillment Systems**: The Labels API can be used to enhance the functionality of order management systems by providing built-in shipping capabilities.
- **POS Systems**: For Point of Sale systems, integrating the Labels API can support ship from store and other fulfillment functionality.
