# Shipping Insights FAQ

## Is the data for past orders available via the Insight API?

No, ShipperHQ does not store shipment data until the Shipping Insights Advanced Feature enabled on a ShipperhQ account. Orders placed before this feature is enabled are not available via the Shipping Insights API.

## Is the Origin address available?

Not currently. We return the Origin name (which is a unique identifier) but do not currently return the full ship-from address for that Origin. The ship-from address used will match the address

## Is Freight Class available via Insight?

Not currently. Freight Class will be added in an upcoming version of the API.
