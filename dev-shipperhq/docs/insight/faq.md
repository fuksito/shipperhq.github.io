# Shipping Insights FAQ

## Is the data for past-order available via the Insight API?

No. The data collection of your orders starts when the `Insight API` is activated for this store (via the "Advanced Feature" management). Historical data produced before the `Insight Actication` is not available.

## Is the origin-location address available via the Insight API?

Not at this time. The `Location ID` is available and can be retrieved but we do not store the address of this location in the Insight data store.

## Is the `freight-class` property available via Insight?

Not at the time.
